# IT-Service-Desk-Automation-Tool
This is an IT Service Desk Automation Tool intended to be run after clean installation of windows 10 to configure common settings

It is a tool i have written during my internship at Wegagen Bank SC. to solve a task redundancy problem on my day to day task. I used the powershell scripting language for the logic and winform for the GUI of the application.

# Why this tool?

Even though this doesnâ€™t seem much at first this tool saves me a little time and frustration when performing the post-installation configuration procedure. Normally when working without this tool I have to remember the set of tasks I need to perform after the installation of windows, then perform them one by one by searching each setting inside different places, then do the same task over and over again for n number of the computers we have. During my benchmark, I measured the time it takes to do this task was about 5 min. When I was performing this task on five computers it would take me about 25 minutes. Apart from the time it consumes imagine going through multiple settings to perform simple tasks and repeating them, again and again, it was very frustrating. But with this tool, it would take me 5 min tops saving me 20 min of my time.

# How it works?

This simple interface is composed of labels, text boxes, and buttons. When the buttons are clicked they fire up an event that runs a specific function. If that function needs an input parameter the event will run other functions to fulfill the data requirement and at last, it executes the specified task according to the function instruction.
